Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering Complexity â€“ As software systems grew larger, techniques like structured programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), and design patterns were introduced to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability.

Mastering Process â€“ To manage software development effectively, structured methodologies evolved, including Waterfall (1970s) for linear development, Agile (2000s) for iterative and flexible workflows, and DevOps (2010s) for continuous integration and delivery.

Mastering Machines â€“ Advancements in computing led to assembly language (1950s), high-level programming languages like C and Java (1970s-1990s), and cloud computing (2000s-present), enabling scalable and distributed software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
design - building the framework. 
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Scenario:
Developing a banking system where strict regulatory compliance and well-defined specifications are required.
Building a medical device software that must pass rigorous certifications before deployment.
Agile Scenario:
Developing a mobile app where user feedback and market trends influence frequent updates.
Creating a startup website that evolves based on user interaction and business needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications, programs, and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practices when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirements before deployment. 
- analyze the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open-source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and leads the software development team.
 - discuss the project and its requirements with the client and software developers.
 - create the blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
IDE-IMPORTANCE
Code Assistance: Provides features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools.
Efficiency: Helps developers write, compile, and run code within a single environment.
Error Detection: Identifies bugs and syntax errors in real time.
Automation: Supports automated testing and builds.
 Examples:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) â€“ Lightweight, supports multiple languages, extensions, and debugging tools.
IntelliJ IDEA â€“ Popular for Java development, offering smart code completion and refactoring tools.
PyCharm â€“ Specialized in Python development with built-in debugging and testing features.
VCS-IMPORTANCE
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
Change Tracking: Keeps a history of all changes, making it easy to review and revert to previous versions if needed.
Branching and Merging: Allow different versions of the project to be developed in parallel and later merged.
Error Recovery: Helps restore working versions if new changes introduce bugs.
ðŸ”¹ Examples:

Git â€“ The most widely used VCS, supports distributed version control and is used with platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
SVN (Subversion) â€“ A centralized VCS, often used in enterprise environments.
Mercurial â€“ Another distributed VCS known for its performance and scalability.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture and emphasize reliability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist of testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security.
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
